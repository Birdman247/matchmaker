Hi!

I'm Zander Bird, a Physics major at Lewis University.

Just to get to know me; I'm local to the school and have lived in Illinois my whole life. Lately I have been dropping hobbies as I am becoming increasingly more busy, 
but I love to get outdoors whenever I can and go on long bike rides or runs. 

Ypu can contact me at my personal email 
-zanderbird1@gmail.com
Or my school email
-alexandertbird@lewisu.edu
